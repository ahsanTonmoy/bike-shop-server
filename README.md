# üö¥ Bike Store API

This repository contains a complete Postman Collection for the **Bike Store** project, including APIs for authentication, user management, product (bike) management, and order processing. It's built for developers working on or testing a backend system for an online bike store.

## üîó API Overview

The collection is organized into several folders for easier navigation:

- **Auth** - Handles user registration, login, token refresh, and password management.
- **User** - Allows users to update their profile.
- **Admin** - Admin-only routes for user management (e.g., viewing all users, blocking users).
- **Bike** - CRUD operations for bike products.
- **Order** - Create orders, get order history, verify payment, and check revenue.
